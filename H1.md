## a) Security hygiene. 
- Users should create complex passwords;
- Do not use the same password for multiple accounts;
- Use two-factor authentication;
- Don't save passwords in the browser;
- Check the security of websites;
- Beware of public Wi-Fi, by connecting to public Wi-Fi, users risk transmitting data to attackers. 
If a person urgently needs the Internet, it is better to use a VPN service to encrypt the data.
- Beware of phishing emails;
- Minimize personal information on social networks;
- Download applications only from official sources;
- Do not click on suspicious links;
- Do not download suspicious attachments to emails and text messages from unknown addresses;
- Use reliable antivirus software;
- Sharing files for work or containing information for internal use only through encrypted services;
- Keep important files safe and protect against data loss by backing them up;
- Before disposing of or selling a computer, tablet or smartphone, 
it is necessary to clean the hard drive to prevent third parties from accessing any personal or business data.


## b) A threat model for imaginary company "Impression Gifts Ltd."

## (1) What are we working on?
### Business Overview

The company specializes in organizing and selling leisure activity experiences in the form of gift certificates. These certificates allow customers to give their friends, family, or loved ones the opportunity to enjoy memorable and unique experiences. The business model is built on customer satisfaction, trust, and convenience, ensuring that users can easily select and give meaningful experiences while the company manages relationships with multiple service providers to deliver these experiences reliably.

To simplify the selection process, experiences are categorized by target audience and type:

### Audience categories:

- For children
- For family
- For her
- For him
- For two (couples)
- Extreme (adventurous experiences)
- Hobbies (creative or skill-based activities)
- Spa
- Quests (puzzles, escape rooms, interactive challenges)

### Experience topics:

Beauty, flights, shooting, romance, masterclass training, water activities, sports, museums, excursions, massage, photo sessions, driving, country recreation

Each gift certificate allows the recipient to select one out of ten possible experiences within the chosen category, providing flexibility while ensuring the experience matches their interests. The business runs primarily through its website where customers:

- Browse experiences (categories & topics)
- Add selected experiences to a cart
- Pay online
- Receive a gift certificate (most likely digital, e.g., PDF/code)

The company collaborates with external service providers (such as spas, museums, adventure companies) to deliver the selected experiences.

### Assets

The most critical:
- Customer payment data (credit card, bank transfer)
- Gift certificate codes (if stolen = direct financial loss)
- Customer personal data (PII: names, emails, phone numbers)
- Company–provider agreements (contracts, pricing details)

Important but secondary:
- Website availability (downtime = lost revenue & reputation)
- Customer trust & brand reputation
- Employee credentials (back office/admin access)

### Customer Touchpoints

- Website (catalog, shopping cart, payment)
- Mobile version or app
- Email (order confirmations, e-gift delivery)
- Customer support (helpdesk, email, chat)

## (2) What can go wrong?
### Method STRIDE

Threats:

### Spoofing identity

- Fake website (phishing) to steal card details
- Attacker impersonates customer service

### Tampering

- Modification of gift certificate codes (fraud)
- Altering booking/availability info from providers
- Injecting malicious code into website

### Repudiation

- Customer disputes purchase ("I never bought this gift")
- Provider denies receiving a valid voucher
  
### Information Disclosure

- Data breach exposing customer personal information, payment details
- Leaking contract terms with providers

### Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)

- Website unavailable during high sales period (Christmas)
- Payment interruption, no purchases possible

### Elevation of Privilege

- Attacker gains admin rights, issues unlimited gift codes
- Internal fraud: employee generates free vouchers for friends or for personal use

### Risk Prioritization 

| Threat                         | Probability   | Impact                                  | Risk Level |
|--------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| Data breach personal information, payment details   | Medium–High   | Very High (GDPR fines, loss of trust)  | Critical   |
| Gift code falsification/theft        | Medium        | High (direct financial loss)            | High       |
| Website downtime (DoS)         | High | Medium–High (lost sales)          | High       |
| Payment fraud / stolen cards   | Medium        | High (chargebacks, reputation)         | High       |
| Internal fraud/ misuse of codes        | Low–Medium    | High (hard to detect, financial loss)  | Medium     |
| Partner system integrity issues| Medium        | Medium (customer experience damaged)   | Medium     |
| Phishing targeting customers   | Medium        | Medium                                  | Medium     |

### Threat Actors

- Cybercriminals: motivated by financial gain (stealing card details, gift codes)
- Fraudsters: abusing discount codes, forging vouchers
- Internal: employees misusing access

### Known TTPs

- Credential stuffing (from leaks)
- Phishing campaigns
- SQL injection

### Business Continuity Concern
Website downtime will cause zero sales and immediate revenue loss.

## (3) What are we going to do about it?

### Reduce attack surface:

- Use a reputable payment service, never store card data locally.
- Secure gift code generation with cryptographically strong random values.

### Mitigate risks:

- Encrypt customer data 
- Implement Web Application Firewall protection against common web vulnerabilities.

### Eliminate risks:

- Do not store unnecessary sensitive data 
- Automate certificate validation process with providers to reduce fraud opportunities.

### Transfer risks:

- Obtain cyber insurance to cover fraud and data breaches.
- Outsource hosting to a secure cloud provider.

### Accept minor risks:

- Inform users about the specifics of our products to reduce the risk of low-impact phishing attempts.

## (4) Did we do a good enough job?

- Annual security audits and penetration testing.
- Monitoring and detecting suspicious voucher redemptions, failed logins.
- Have a clear incident response plan of actions in case breaches, DoS, fraud.
- Continuous threat modeling.
