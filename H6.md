**Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor**

Tor allows users to act anonymously, useful for privacy in journalism, family protection, activism, and other non-criminal activities.

Tor is open-source and secure platform, maintained by cryptographers and activists, there are no backdoors or inherent phishing, it dedicated to privacy and anonymity.

Using Tor is not illegal. Legality depends on how it is used. Criminal use can lead to legal consequences.

Access methods:

- Tor Browser Bundle – standard way to use Tor.

- Tails operating system – routes the entire Internet connection through Tor.

Tor is slower than regular browsers, however, users can contribute to the network by creating more relays, which helps increase its speed.

Tor provides strong anonymity if used correctly. Users must follow security rules and be aware of traffic analysis risks.

**Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser**

Tor (The Onion Router) hides a user’s IP address, enabling anonymous browsing and communication. It is designed to be simple to use and provides effective anonymity.

History: Originally developed by the U.S. government in 2002, Tor is now maintained by a global community of privacy experts and is not controlled by a single entity.

How it works: Tor routes encrypted data through multiple relays (entry, middle, exit). Each relay removes a layer of encryption before passing it on, making it difficult to trace the original source. Bridges exist as non-public relays for added security.

The main vulnerability is user behavior. Allowing scripts, plugins, or sharing location can expose the real IP. Investigators may try techniques like traffic correlation, controlling nodes, or man-in-the-middle attacks. Ultimately, investigations aim to reveal the true IP, often relying on user mistakes.

I installed Tor Browser and accessed the Tor Network. Here are the sites I managed to find: the first one is a news site, Reuters, which also has an official clearnet site. 
Another site I found is BillingCat, which has an onion address. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any interesting marketplaces
