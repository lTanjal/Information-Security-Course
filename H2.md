# APT Defense & Kill Chain Summary

Traditional defenses target viruses/worms but fall short against targeted Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) intrusions. 

APT response requires intelligence-driven analysis, processes, and technology to anticipate and disrupt future attacks.

## Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense (CND):
- Builds resilience by understanding threat intent, capabilities, doctrine, and patterns.
- Forcing adversaries to expend more effort and cost.
- Acts as continuous process of detecting activity via indicators.

  ### Indicators:
    - Atomic – indivisible (IP, email, vuln ID).
    - Computed – derived (hashes, regex).
    - Behavioral – combinations of atomic/computed indicators with logic/context.

## Kill chain phases:

- Reconnaissance – Researching targets (websites, mailing lists, social data, tech info).
- Weaponization – Creating malicious payloads.
- Delivery – Transmitting payload (common vectors: email attachments, websites, USB).
- Exploitation – Triggering code execution via vulnerabilities, social engineering, or OS features.
- Installation – Deploying malware/backdoor for persistence.
- Command & Control (C2) – Compromised host connects to attacker’s server for manual control.
- Actions on Objectives – Executing mission (data theft, disruption, lateral movement).
  
Adversaries must succeed at each phase; disrupting one phase blocks them.

## Campaign analysis focuses on:
- Understanding intruders’ intent and objectives.
- Identifying patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- Building a roadmap to prioritize focused security measures.

Defenders gain tactical advantage if countermeasures evolve faster than adversaries.

The intrusion kill chain provides a structure to analyze attacks, extract indicators, and guide defensive actions.

**Tactic** is the adversary’s immediate objective at a particular stage of an attack, explains why the adversary is performing certain actions.

- Privilege Escalation- gaining higher-level permissions.

**Technique** the general method used to achieves a tactic.

- Access Token Manipulation
  
**Subtechnique** a particular way the technique is executed.
- Token Impersonation/Theft

**Procedure** represents the exact steps, tools, or commands used in a real-world attack.
- BitPaymer is a ransomware, can use stolen tokens of users to create processes on infected systems.
