# APT Defense & Kill Chain Summary 

Traditional defenses target viruses/worms but fall short against targeted Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) intrusions. Hutchins et al 2011 p.1.

APT response requires intelligence-driven analysis, processes, and technology to anticipate and disrupt future attacks. Hutchins et al 2011 p.2.

## Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense (CND):
- Builds resilience by understanding threat intent, capabilities, doctrine, and patterns. Hutchins et al 2011 p.3.
- Forcing adversaries to expend more effort and cost.
- Acts as continuous process of detecting activity via indicators. 

  ### Indicators:
    - Atomic – indivisible (IP, email, vuln ID).
    - Computed – derived (hashes, regex).
    - Behavioral – combinations of atomic/computed indicators with logic/context. Hutchins et al 2011 p.3.

## Kill chain phases:

- Reconnaissance – Researching targets (websites, mailing lists, social data, tech info).
- Weaponization – Creating malicious payloads.
- Delivery – Transmitting payload (common vectors: email attachments, websites, USB).
- Exploitation – Triggering code execution via vulnerabilities, social engineering, or OS features. Hutchins et al 2011 p.4.
- Installation – Deploying malware/backdoor for persistence.
- Command & Control (C2) – Compromised host connects to attacker’s server for manual control.
- Actions on Objectives – Executing mission (data theft, disruption, lateral movement). Hutchins et al 2011 p.5.
  
Adversaries must succeed at each phase; disrupting one phase blocks them. Hutchins et al 2011 p.5.

## Campaign analysis focuses on:
- Understanding intruders’ intent and objectives.
- Identifying patterns, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- Building a roadmap to prioritize focused security measures. Hutchins et al 2011 p.7.

Defenders gain tactical advantage if countermeasures evolve faster than adversaries. Hutchins et al 2011 p.3.

The intrusion kill chain provides a structure to analyze attacks, extract indicators, and guide defensive actions. Hutchins et al 2011 p.12.

--------
**Tactic** is the adversary’s immediate objective at a particular stage of an attack, explains why the adversary is performing certain actions.

- Privilege Escalation- gaining higher-level permissions. Privilege Escalation. 

**Technique** the general method used to achieves a tactic.

- Access Token Manipulation- adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under users or systems and bypass access controls. Access Token Manipulation.
  
**Subtechnique** a particular way the technique is executed.
- Token Impersonation/Theft- adversaries duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Token Impersonation/Theft.

**Procedure** represents the exact steps, tools, or commands used in a real-world attack.
- BitPaymer is a ransomware, can use stolen tokens of users to create processes on infected systems. BitPaymer.
