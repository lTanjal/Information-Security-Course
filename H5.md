-	**Cryptography** – the science of securing information. (Schneier, 2017)
-	**Plaintext** (cleartext) – the original, readable message. (Schneier, 2017)
-	**Encryption** – the process of converting plaintext into a hidden form. (Schneier, 2017)
-	**Ciphertext** – the encrypted, unreadable version of the message. (Schneier, 2017)
-	 **Decryption** – the process of restoring ciphertext back to plaintext. (Schneier, 2017)

The whole process of encrypting and then decrypting a message can be described as follow: 

**D(E(M)) = M**(Schneier, 2017)

M – readable message, plaintext 

E – encrypting

D – decrypting 

**Cryptography** provides not only confidentiality but also:

- 	**Authentication** – verifying the identity of the sender or recipient.
- 	**Integrity**– ensuring that the message has not been altered.
- 	**Nonrepudiation** – preventing the sender from denying having sent the message.
  
Cryptography uses two related mathematical functions: one for encryption and the other for decryption.
This is cryptographic algorithm, also called a cipher. (Schneier, 2017)

Restricted algorithm – an algorithm whose security is based on keeping the way it works a secret.(Schneier, 2017)

A cryptosystem is an algorithm, plus all possible plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys. (Schneier, 2017)

To extend the effective use, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of the cipher, the concept of a so-called key was introduced.(Schneier, 2017)
-	**Keyspace** – the range of all possible values a key can take.
-	Both encryption and decryption operations depend on the key, it can be described as follow function(Schneier, 2017):

**DK(EK(M)) = M**
  
M – readable message, plaintext

E – encrypting

D – decrypting 

K – key 


 **Symmetric algorithms** (or conventional algorithms) use keys where:
 
-	The encryption key can be calculated from the decryption key and vice versa.
-	In most cases, the encryption and decryption keys are the same.
  
To maintain secrecy in communication, the key itself must remain secret.(Schneier, 2017)

**Public-Key (Asymmetric) Algorithms:**

Some algorithms use a different encryption key (public key) and decryption key (private key). 
This process can be described as follow function (Schneier, 2017):

**DK2(EK1 (M)) = M**
  
M – readable message, plaintext 

E – encrypting

D – decrypting 

K1 – encrypting key 

K2  –  decrypting key

-	The decryption key cannot be calculated from the encryption key “public-key”.
-	The encryption key can be made public, while the decryption key remains private.
-	Sometimes messages are encrypted with the private key and decrypted with the public key (for authentication purposes). (Schneier, 2017)
  
The security does not rely on keeping the algorithm secret, as long as the key is unknown to an eavesdropper,
the message remains secure. (Schneier, 2017)

**Cryptanalysis** – the study of recovering plaintext without knowing the key.

-	An attempted cryptanalysis is called an attack.
-	Loss of a key by non-cryptanalytic means is called a compromise.

Main types of cryptanalytic attacks (Schneier, 2017):

1.	**Ciphertext-only attack** – attacker has only ciphertext from messages encrypted with the same algorithm.
    
2.	**Known-plaintext attack** – attacker knows both ciphertext and corresponding plaintext of some messages.
    
3.	**Chosen-plaintext attack** – attacker can choose plaintexts to be encrypted and access their ciphertext.
    
4.	**Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack** – attacker chooses plaintexts based on prior encryption results.
    
5.	**Chosen-ciphertext attack** – attacker can choose ciphertexts to be decrypted and access the resulting plaintext.
    
6.	**Chosen-key attack** – attacker has some knowledge of relationships between different keys.
    
7.	**Rubber-hose cryptanalysis** – attacker uses threats, blackmail, or torture to obtain the key.


**Principles of Algorithm Security**

Data is considered safe if (Schneier, 2017):

-	The cost to break the algorithm exceeds the value of the protected data.
-	The time to break the algorithm is longer than the time the data must remain secret.
-	The amount of encrypted data per key is less than the amount of data needed to break the algorithm.

**Cryptographic Methods (Schneier, 2017)**

-	**Steganography** – hides a secret message inside another message so that its existence is concealed.
-	**Substitution cipher** – replaces each character (or block of characters) in the plaintext with another symbol or group of symbols.
-	**Transposition cipher** – keeps the original characters but changes their order (columnar transposition).
-	**Rotor machine** – uses rotors with alphabet permutations, performing complex substitutions as they rotate.
-	**One-Time Pad** – a sequence of truly random, nonrepeating key symbols. Originally implemented as a paper pad or a tape for teletypes.
   If used correctly, it is theoretically unbreakable.
 	

**Encryption principles (Schneier, 2017)**:

- Each plaintext character is combined with a key character (mod 26).
- Each key symbol is used once and only for one message.
- After use, the key material is destroyed.
- Sender and receiver must both have identical copies of the pad.

**Common Cryptographic Algorithms (Schneier, 2017)**

-	**DES (Data Encryption Standard)** – symmetric algorithm, same key for encryption and decryption.
-	**RSA (named for its creators—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman)** – most widely used public-key algorithm; supports both encryption and digital signatures.
-	**DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**– public-key algorithm used only for digital signatures (not for encryption).

**Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg**

This section describes the preparation process for transmitting an encrypted message using the GPG tool, 
with additional verification of the sender’s signature.

-	As the sender, a simulated user Alice is created as a separate folder named Alice in the home directory.
-	The recipient of the message is the main user.
  
For the main user:

-	A pair of keys is generated: Public and Secret.
-	The Public key is copied from the main user’s directory into the Alice directory.
  
For Alice:

-	Using the main user’s Public key, Alice encrypts a message and sends it to the main user.
-	Alice requests the main user to read the message aloud to verify that the Public key indeed belongs to the main user.
-	After successful verification, Alice generates its own key pair: Public and Secret.
-	The Public key of Alice is copied into the main user’s directory.
  
Now the following becomes possible:

-	From the Alice folder, Alice can encrypt a message with the Public key of the main user.
-	The message is then signed with the Secret key of Alice.
  
On the recipient’s side:

-	The main user uses their Secret key to decrypt the message.
-	The GPG tool verifies that the signature can be validated with the key already present in the trusted key list. And this key is confirmed to belong to Alice.

## a)
I updated the package list **sudo apt-get update**
Then used **sudo apt-get install ssh** to install OpenSSH server.
There following keys were created during the installation: 
-	**RSA key** 
RSA (named for its creators—Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) – most widely used public-key algorithm; supports both encryption and digital signatures.(Schneier, 2017)
-	**ECDSA key**
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm  is a type of advanced public-key algorithm used for creating digital signatures, which serve as an authentication method to verify the identity of the sender or recipient of information. (Manimit Haldar, 2024)

-	**ED25519** key is a high-performance and secure public-key solution for digital signatures, based on the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA). (ed25519 vs other keys for SSH, 2025)
After I used ip a to get the IP address of my VR machine, started sudo systemctl start ssh to active
the server and connected to OpenSSH with the command ssh username@IP  (Tero Karvinen, 2025)

## b)	
I used **ssh-keygen -t ed25519** to generate SSH key pairs (a private key and a corresponding public key) for secure authentication on my host machine.
 **-t ed25519** – Specifies the type of key to create.

I could not use this command **ssh-copy-id**, as it raised the error that this command is not recognized on my Windows PowerShell.

I connected with my VR machine through ssh, created a file named authorized_keys in home dir .ssh folder using **nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys** (ChatGpt)
and pasted my pub there from my host.

I change read and write mode of authorized_keys to -rw-------  with 
**chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys** that only VM user can read/write it. (ChatGpt)

Then I used
**ssh -i $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\my_private_keys myUserName@VM_IP** (ChatGpt) 
and connected with my VR without password.

## c)
**KeePassXC** is free, does not run in the cloud. (KeePassXC, 2025)

KeePassXC generates strong random passwords for new accounts and stores them securely. To use stored credentials, there are two main options:

**With the browser extension**

- User unlocks the database with own master password (and/or key file).
- User opens browser and goes to a website login page.
- On the login page, user clicks the KeePassXC-Browser extension icon in the toolbar.
- The extension checks the website address, retrieves the matching entry from KeePassXC, and shows the available account(s).
- After user has selected the account, the extension automatically fills in the username and password fields.

  or **Manual copy–paste**
  
- User unlocks the database with own master password (and/or key file).
- User finds the entry that is needed for the app or the website.
- User copies the username or password and pastes it into the app/website. KeePass clears the clipboard automatically after a few seconds.

Password reuse and weak, easy-to-guess passwords are among the biggest risks when using online services. If just one service is compromised—whether through poor password strength or a security vulnerability—attackers may gain access to many of user's other accounts. A password manager helps solve this problem by securely storing users credentials in an encrypted database. It can generate strong, unique passwords for each site, making them far harder to guess or crack. User only needs to remember one master password to unlock the manager and access all user's accounts.
