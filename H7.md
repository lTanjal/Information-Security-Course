Tor allows users to act anonymously, useful for privacy in journalism, family protection, activism, and other non-criminal activities.

Tor is open-source and secure platform, maintained by cryptographers and activists, there are no backdoors or inherent phishing, it dedicated to privacy and anonymity.

Using Tor is not illegal. Legality depends on how it is used. Criminal use can lead to legal consequences.

Access methods:

- Tor Browser Bundle – standard way to use Tor.

- Tails operating system – routes the entire Internet connection through Tor.

Tor is slower than regular browsers, however, users can contribute to the network by creating more relays, which helps increase its speed.

Tor provides strong anonymity if used correctly. Users must follow security rules and be aware of traffic analysis risks.

I installed Tor Browser and accessed the Tor Network. Here are the sites I managed to find: the first one is a news site, Reuters, which also has an official clearnet site. 
Another site I found is BillingCat, which has an onion address. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any interesting marketplaces
